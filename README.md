=====
*Developing a next-generation framework for ECMAScript 5, built for modern browsers and server environments.*

**tempo** serves two purposes:

1. Today, **tempo** is a loosely-knit group of experimental projects. Many of these projects (such as [Harmonize](Harmonize), [Spawn](Spawn), and candy) are meant to be released as stand-alone mini-libraries. However, they are also intended to serve as the backbone for a larger framework.

2. Going forward, **tempo** is intended to be developed into a cohesive, large-scale framework.
